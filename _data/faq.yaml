    Given the ceremony is at 12pm we'd advise having a substantial breakfast or brunch. There will some refreshments at the back of the church after the ceremony. Our wedding breakfast will be at 4pm.

- question: What time will the reception end?
  answer: |
    Carriages are at midnight and we highly advise pre-booking taxis. Once we know where everyone is staying and there needs we will try and help with transportation organisation.

- question: What do I do if I want to camp?
  answer: |
    Please let us know via the RSVP form should you wish to bring a campervan or pitch a tent. Depending on numbers there is the option to glamp in a yurt at an approximate fee of £80 per couple. 
    Tents can be pitched in one of the many beautiful paddocks close to the house. There is no additional cost to camping and toilets and water will be available for use overnight, although the bar will have run out!
