# Static Wedding Site

A static site I built in 2024 for guests of our wedding to get more information on the days events and where to stay.

Thank you to [Nathan Orick](https://github.com/cnorick) for building this Jekyll template which is very customisable

## Struggles

* Not being that familiar with Jekyll templates
* Hosting on Github pages and setting up a custom domain
* Utilising the themes template RSVP form submit to record data to a google sheet.
